To develop ourselves and our competencies we need inspiration, so thanks to my colleague [Magnify](http://magnify.dk/) we now have a bi-weekly inspiration hour where a member of our team choose a topic and a talk for everyone to see.

### One design to rule the all

Last friday we all saw a [talk by Luke Wroblewski held @ BDConf 2013](http://vimeo.com/64202295). An inspiring talk about create one design to rule all our screens.
