Today's injection of inspiration came from two TED talks.

First I watched [Dan Pink on The puzzle of motivation](http://new.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation) and inspiring talk about what motivated people to perform.

One key element I can take with me from this talk is that incentives don't allways work, they don't allways motivate people. Instead the drive to do things for their own sake. The drive to do things cause they matter have a much higher influence on great results. This is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.

Next I watched [Simon Sinek on How great leaders inspire action](http://new.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action).

The key take away is definetly People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it. Tell people what you believe not what you do or how you do itâ€¦ Martin Luther King  held the I have a dream speech not the I have a plan speech. Thoose who lead inspire us. We follow not because we have to, but because we want to.

Now go watch yourself, highly recommende.
