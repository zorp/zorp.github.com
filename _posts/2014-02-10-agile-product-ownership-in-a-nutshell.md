Our bi-weekly inspirational hour at work was this week organized by myself, I had choosen a short animated movie explaining all about product ownerships and the process in a agile scrum based development environment.

It's a really great intro to how things should/could be. Great inspiration to our own process and led to some great discussions afterwards.

Whatch the presentation below.
