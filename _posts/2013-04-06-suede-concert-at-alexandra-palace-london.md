A week ago I went to visit [Alexandra Palace](http://www.alexandrapalace.com/ "Alexandra Palace website") to see and hear [Suede](http://www.suede.co.uk/) in concert for the first time in 13 years. Suede have just released a new album [Bloodsport](http://open.spotify.com/album/0KxFgCRvWpee2Dd7D7kRyM "Listen to Bloodsports on Spotify"), which by the way is very very good. They still got it.

The concert was awesome, I enjoyed every bit. Nearly as good as in the good old days :)

You can find plenty of [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Suede+%40+Alexandra+Palace+2013&oq=Suede+%40+Alexandra+Palace+2013&gs_l=youtube.3...5457.18254.0.18398.15.14.1.0.0.0.84.992.14.14.0...0.0...1ac.1.LEUZbJIBFwM "Youtube search result") from this epic night at Alexandra Palace.

Proff that I was there.
